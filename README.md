# img-processing
It's a project for detecting text in images and convert it to actual text could be copied.
unfortunately the model needs more data sets to train as the accuracy is not the best but it works well for images with clear, well-seperated words.
we used a liberary called pytesseract with some image enhancments using OpenCV liberary in python.
